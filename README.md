# EGU Calendar Extractor

A tool to extract events from EGU-style personal programme PDFs and convert them into `.ics` calendar files that can be added in your favorite calendar app. To download your personal program, got to [https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/personal_programme](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/personal_programme), log in and click on the *Print* blue button after having selected events.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Parses individual talks, sessions, and miscellaneous events (e.g. short courses)
- Detects embedded hyperlinks from the PDF
- Outputs a `.ics` file with room-based or category-based color coding (only works when the .ics file is loaded in iCalendar (Apple), and not all the time...)

> [!CAUTION]
> Non-numbered sessions, such as the ones in GeoCinema are currently **not parsed and not added** to the calendar.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### [Preferred/All] Option 1: Copy `core.py` into your notebook or script

If you have python installed on your computer, you simply copy the file `egucalendarextractor/core.py` where your PDF file is, and then run

```python
from egucalendarextractor.core import extract_events_from_pdf, write_ics
events = extract_events_from_pdf("input.pdf")
write_ics(events, "output.ics")
```

You will need the python packages: pymupdf, matplotlib and numpy

### [Preferred/Linux] Option 1: Copy `core.py` into your notebook or script

Under linux (and maybe mac?), you simply copy the file `egucalendarextractor/core.py` where your PDF file is, and then run

```bash
python core.py file.pdf EGU25_schedule.ics
```
You will need the python packages: pymupdf, matplotlib and numpy

<!-- ### Option 2: As a CLI tool

```bash
python egucalendarextractor/core.py input.pdf output.ics
``` -->

### [Only if necessary] Option 3: Use with the webapp

I have hosted the code on the Streamlit Community Cloud [here](https://egucalendarextractor.streamlit.app/), which is free but **will not hold if there are too many simultaneous users**. Please, only uses this if you do not have any access to python.
